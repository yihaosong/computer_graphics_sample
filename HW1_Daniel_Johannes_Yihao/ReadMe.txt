Dear Prof. Wolberg and Prof. Zokai:
	This homework assignment is done by Daniel Intskirveli, Johannes Christ and Yihao Song. Can you please check it and
notify us if we made any mistake? Thank you so much for you time.
	For the record, in HW1a, we flip the 4th viewport, because we think it was a funny thing to do. So please let us know if
this is not acceptable. Again, thank you. Have a nice evening.
